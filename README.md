# NCSS
Non-canonical splice sites

`/out/bl2seq` files were generated with orthologs.py

* `000celegans.fa` contains a non-canonical splice site.
* `000orth_00.fa` contains an orthologous gene with a non-canonical splice site
* `000orth_01.fa` contains a different orthologous gene with a non-canonical splice site

The orthologs were pulled from *C. briggsae*, *C. brenneri*, and *C. japonica*.
